Unfortunately the geometry of the follower shaft prevents us from using
Daniels fancy wedge adjustable idea. A convenient alternate would be to 
use two springs with different tensions on each side. The issue with that
design is that the springs would cause the shaft to be not horizontal. 
This could be fixed by putting hard stops on both spring-rods, preventing
the shaft from getting too out of alignment.
